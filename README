>Inside the project directory use the following command: cargo run transacciones.txt 2 0.50
Argument 1 is the text file that contains the data set to be processed. .txt must be in project root.
Argument 2 is integer value that represents minimum support.
Argument 3 is a decimal value between 0 and 1 that represents minimum confidence percentage.


Output example using the command mentioned above and sample data set provided.
